Lila (li[chess in sca]la) is a free online chess game server focused on [realtime](https://lichess.org/games) gameplay and ease of use.

It features a [search engine](https://lichess.org/games/search),
[computer analysis](https://lichess.org/ief49lif) distributed with [fishnet](https://github.com/niklasf/fishnet),
[tournaments](https://lichess.org/tournament),
[simuls](https://lichess.org/simul),
[forums](https://lichess.org/forum),
[teams](https://lichess.org/team),
[tactic trainer](https://lichess.org/training),
a [mobile app](https://lichess.org/mobile),
and a [shared analysis board](https://lichess.org/study).
The UI is available in more than [130 languages](https://crowdin.com/project/lichess) thanks to the community.

Lichess is written in [Scala 2.13](https://www.scala-lang.org/),
and relies on the [Play 2.8](https://www.playframework.com/) framework.
[scalatags](http://www.lihaoyi.com/scalatags/) is used for templating.
Pure chess logic is contained in the [scalachess](https://github.com/ornicar/scalachess) submodule.
The server is fully asynchronous, making heavy use of Scala Futures and [Akka streams](http://akka.io).
WebSocket connections are handled by a [seperate server](https://github.com/ornicar/lila-ws) that communicates using [redis](https://redis.io/).
Lichess talks to [Stockfish](http://stockfishchess.org/) deployed in an [AI cluster](https://github.com/niklasf/fishnet) of donated servers.
It uses [MongoDB](https://mongodb.org) to store more than 1.7 billion games, which are indexed by [elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org).
HTTP requests and WebSocket connections can be proxied by [nginx](http://nginx.org).
The web client is written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom), using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to generate CSS.
The [blog](https://lichess.org/blog) uses a free open content plan from [prismic.io](https://prismic.io).
All rated games are published in a [free PGN database](https://database.lichess.org).
Browser testing done with [![Browserstack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ornicar/lila/master/public/images/browserstack.png)](https://www.browserstack.com).
